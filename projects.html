            <p>year: 2025</p>
            <p>material: electroformed copper</p>
            <p>My first approach worked with the tension between used and unused surfaces of objects. Onto these quiet areas I grew electroformed copper guided by a coral-like doodle motif, a pattern that slowly spread and thickened through the process. The result was a series of vases where delicate, hand-drawn lines turned into solid metallic growths — fragile sketches becoming enduring structures. These pieces examined how absence can be activated and how overlooked details can gain new material presence.</p>

            <p>Our final semester’s task was to design an award in a client-based situation with the participation of the Capital Circus of Budapest. I chose to design for the Newcomer Show Prize.</p>
            <p> For this, I started my research along the keywords of tradition, playfulness, and status. This led me to the classic, pointed clown hat as the main motif, an emblematic form that has accompanied circuses for centuries, from the commedia dell’arte troupes through Pierrot to today’s white clowns. This way, passing on a hatful of tradition to young talents.</p>
            <p>My material choice fell on porcelain due to its pure white appearance, nobility, and ability to be mass-produced.</p>

        <p>material: copper</p>
        <p> In our fifth semester, our task was to design a bowl, with the requirement of using metal as the central material. Once again, I embarked on an experiment, this time delving into the technique of electroforming.</p>
        <p>The essence of this technique lies in creating a thicker metal layer through electrolysis, either as an independent object or as a coating. Historically, it was primarily used in printing, and currently, it’s used for museum replicas. However, the crystalline, wild formations produced as a byproduct were considered undesirable in the industry and were concealed.</p>
        <p> I aimed to showcase this duality of objects created through this technique in my bowl set, drawing formal inspiration from 20th-century digital diagrams depicting the effect of gravity on the space-time continuum.</p>

    <p> In this design task, we had to safely encase a blown quail egg in an alternative way in jewelry. In contrast to its small, fragile shell, I began to think about a flexible encasing layer, the final material of which became a dual-layer silicone.</p>
    <p> In its formal design, I returned to the motif of the egg, creating a turned-out, flipped-up caricature of it, tying a knot on its pinched „white” to make the jewelry wearable around the neck. The pattern form was turned from aluminum, from which the silicone pattern was created.</p>
    <p> Due to the jewelry’s hollow and flexible nature, it can be stretched and fitted with a tool, allowing the delicate eggshell to be placed inside. Thus, the opening serves not only an aesthetic role, showcasing the internal content when worn, but also functions as a functional aperture.</p>

    <p> Another design task of our semester was to create a novel setting for a traditional, faceted gemstone.</p>
    <p>For this, I chose wood as the base material, intrigued by its flexibility. I designed an elongated shape that, through wedging, would accommodate the stone snugly. To prevent breakage, laminated wood proved most suitable for the task. Pre-cutting the stone bed ensured its stability, and to prevent it from being pulled out, I also equipped the ring with an additional copper strap.</p>
    <p> Formally, I was inspired by the rounded nature of the stone’s cut and the central symmetry of its grip. By shifting the cleavage in one direction, a more unified, gestural form emerges when viewed from the side.</p>

    <p> The craft task related to the semester also aimed at setting. Here, we had to design a ring with an alternative grip for a given shaped stone.</p>
    <p> As a challenge, I aimed to create a tension jewelry piece, for which I began using steel early on due to its flexibility and toughness. To split the hard steel wire ring that tensions around the spherical mineral, I personally made the hand-operated tool.</p>

    <P>The design task of this semester was titled „Monolith” requiring our jewelry to be made from a continuous material. My goal was to experiment with materials, for which I found the mycelium composite to be a promising innovation.</P>
    <P>Thematically, I aligned this earring with Stella McCartney’s Spring 2022 collection, which featured mushroom leather bags. For the basic appearance, I chose the ear protector shape worn by water polo players, fitting with the breakthroughs seen in the collection, which add excitement to the visibility of the ear.</P>
    <p>The material experiments yielded good results with the mushroom. Through multipart gypsum and wax growth forms, the jewelry pieces were fully formed.</p>

    <p>This design task of the semester was the utilization of paper at the level of jewelry. In this, I found the layering of various qualities of paper to be an exciting challenge. The rhythmic alternation of crepe, photo cardboard, and tracing paper resulted in dynamic striping.</p>
    <p>The papers were fastened together using bookbinding techniques, evoking the mood of Japanese notebooks. To enhance the concept’s dynamism, some jewelry pieces featured red-and-white binding thread.</p>
    <p>After finding the baseline and establishing a regular system, I expanded the work towards more chaotic arrangements to explore the widest palette possible. In the latter, emotional expression began to emerge, serving as a therapeutic approach to stress management.</p>

    <p>Our admission to university began with our first summer camp, during which we familiarized ourselves with the technique of bronze casting in a task named „Structure”. Using wax sheets and rod materials, we were tasked with creating a structure, preparing it for casting, pouring it on-site, and then refining it later in the semester.</p>
    <p>I aimed to create a freely treated constructivist-style sculpture, where the rod materials seemingly penetrate the sheets, whose surfaces vary in pairs.</p>

    <p>In the elective course of the second semester, under the title „Body of Smoke,” we were tasked with creating a plastic object with an incense holder function. We had to choose some form of vitality as our inspirational basis.</p>
    <p>I drew inspiration from the shapes of puffball mushrooms, as their spore dispersal is very similar to the movement of smoke, thus creating a fitting combination. To achieve this, I poured plaster into flexible tubes and manipulated them until I obtained the desired form.</p>
    <p>During our usual summer camp in Mezőtúr, the object was cast. For this, I needed to build an internal inlet system to preserve the natural surface of the casting outside.</p>

    <p>I created this object during our foundry course called „Malmivalu” in Tallinn. The technique used was a special foam casting method, where I made a knotted form out of styrofoam. After creating sprues, I molded it in sand, and as the molten iron flows in, it burns away the foam form, taking its place.</p>
    <p>The idea of knotting comes from my childhood, where the four-square braid is its name, which I usually used for my zippers and other items.</p>
    <p>The knot itself is a symbol of infinity, intertwining into itself, forever standing unbreakable. The rusting, as a surface treatment, symbolizes the factor of time in the context, questioning the eternity of the sculpture’s afterlife.</p>

    <p>This smaller sculpture was also created during the Malmivalu foundry course, using wax casting.</p>
    <p>My playful concept encompassed an object that, like the „Jack-in-the-box,” always returns to its original position. The base shape was a sphere, from which I carved out the hollow object with a heavier bottom. To further enhance the playful aspect, I also made a conical rod with a strong magnet inserted into it, allowing the rocking sculpture to be pulled out of its initial position.</p>
